# Leihbase

Leihbase is a web application that covers every aspect of running one or
multiple Borrow Stores (or Libraries of Things): community-driven spaces where
people can borrow items instead of buying them.

## Features

  the store

## Tech

- Back-end and API using [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/)
- Front-end with server-side rendering using [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)

## Deployment

### Docker

Leihbase has two Docker Images available which are both required to set up the
application:

- [leihbase-webapp](https://hub.docker.com/r/lumocra/leihbase-webapp)
- [leihbase-pb](https://hub.docker.com/r/lumocra/leihbase-pb)

Images are tagged with the release version, `latest` is built from the `next`
branch. Pinning a release version is recommended.

Use the following docker-compose.yml as a base to deploy Leihbase using Docker:

```yaml
services:
  leihbase-webapp:
    image: lumocra/leihbase-webapp:v2.3.0

| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

#### Email

To send emails (reservation confirmations, reminders, notifications), configure
an SMTP server in the PocketBase admin interface (`/_/` > Settings > Mail
settings). Pickup and return reminders are sent by a cron job every day at 12:00
(UTC).

To find out when sending emails stops working (e.g. the SMTP server is
unreachable), set `CONFIG_MAIL_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` to a webhook URL, such as a
[Discord channel webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668).
A failed email is then posted there, at most once per hour, with the recipient
address partly hidden.

#### Updating & backups

Database migrations are applied automatically when PocketBase starts, so
updating is a matter of changing the image versions and restarting the
containers. Make sure to back up the `pb_data` volume before updating, it
contains all data and uploaded files.

### Fly.io

The repository contains [fly.toml](https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/)
files to deploy the service as [fly.io](https://fly.io) applications.

### Initial setup

Leihbase does not have a setup flow yet. After starting the services, enter some
initial data to be able to use the application:

1. Browse to `<leihbase-pb url>/_/` to visit the PocketBase admin interface
1. Create a PocketBase superuser account
1. Create a record in the `leihbase` collection, containing some configuration
   settings for the instance (see [Configuration](#configuration))
1. Create a location in the `location` collection (make sure to set the location
   as 'active')
1. Create a product in the `products` collection (make sure to set the product
   as 'active')
1. Sign up via the front-end, and in the PocketBase admin interface set the
   `role` of your user in the `users` collection to `admin` to get access to the
   Leihbase admin section
1. Now you should be able to visit the front-end

## Configuration

### Users & roles

Users have a `role` which can be set in the PocketBase admin interface in the
`users` collection:

- `user`: can make and manage their own reservations
- `manager`: can manage the products, reservations and opening hours of the
  locations selected in the user's `manager_locations` field
- `admin`: can manage all locations, and the email templates

### Leihbase

The single record in the `leihbase` collection contains instance-wide settings:

- `description`, `image`: shown on the front page
- `imprint`, `privacy_policy`: content of the imprint and privacy policy pages
- `privacy_policy_link`: if set, users have to accept it when signing up
- `privacy_policy`: the current privacy policy, edited in the admin section
  (Instance settings, see [Privacy policy](#privacy-policy)). Replaces
  `privacy_policy_link` when set
- `footer_links`: links shown in the footer, in the same JSON format as location
  [links](#links)
- `currency`: currency of deposits on the website and in emails, as an ISO 4217
  code such as `EUR` (the default when empty), `GBP` or `CHF`
- `borrow_agreement`: borrowing terms of all locations without borrowing terms
  of their own, edited in the admin section (Instance settings, see
  [Borrowing terms](#borrowing-terms))
- `style`: CSS variables to theme the front-end, for example:

```css
--background-color: #ffdbc4;
--primary-color: #0d79f2;
--secondary-color: #ffede2;
--text-color: #061134;
--border-radius: 5px;
```

### Email templates

Admins can customize the emails sent by Leihbase per location in the admin
section (Settings > Configure email templates). If no custom template is
enabled, the default template for the configured locale is used.

### Location

#### Notifications

Using the following JSON format the email addresses which should receive
notifications of this location can be configured:

```json
["example@example.com", "sarah@example.com"]
```

#### Links

Links shown on the location page.

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Leihbar Website",
    "link": "https://leihbar-koeln.de"
  }
]
```

#### Borrowing terms

Admins can define borrowing terms per location in the admin section (Settings >
Borrowing terms). Users have to accept them before their first reservation at
the location.

Borrowing terms for all locations are defined in the instance settings (Admin >
Instance settings). They apply to every location without borrowing terms of its
own, and users accept them once for all those locations: when signing up, or
after they changed. They're shown on the `/borrowing-terms` page.

#### Privacy policy

The privacy policy can be written in the instance settings (Admin > Instance
settings), and is shown on the `/privacy` page. Users accept it when signing up,
and the accepted version is stored.

When the privacy policy or the borrowing terms for all locations change, users
are asked to review and accept the new version on their next visit, unless the
change was saved as a minor edit. Without a privacy policy, the
`privacy_policy_link` is used for sign-up, as before.

With 'allow accepting later' enabled, users can reserve without accepting them,
and accept them later or in the store. When the borrowing terms are changed,
users have to accept them again.

The reservations overview shows which users haven't accepted the current
borrowing terms, and managers and admins can record an acceptance in the store
from the reservation.

#### Opening Hours

Managers and admins can edit the opening hours of a location in the admin
section (Opening hours), including closed dates such as holidays. In the
reservation dialog, pickup and return dates can only be chosen on opening days.
A location without opening hours is treated as open every day.
